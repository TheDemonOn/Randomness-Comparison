## Random Test

Random Test shows the difference between Pseudo-random and “True random” generation methods. Random Test can be used to generate large amounts of random 0’s & 1’s to visualize the distribution of streaks in the two different methods. It was built using Next.js, uses features such as React Context & Chart.js, and utilizes Random.org’s API to generate True random values using atmospheric noise.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
